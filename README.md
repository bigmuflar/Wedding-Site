# Wedding-Site
This engagment page is designed and developed for the married couples to be (and the aspiring coder, soon to be husband or wife).

1. Contains a fluid one page story line explaining the couples history for those attending the wedding that may not already know.
2. The default.js file contains custom speed movements of the scroll and photo carousels for added glamour.
3. The form at the bottom (wedding guest signup) should be linked to a database containing the required reservation fields.

Happy coding future married couples!
